‚öñÔ∏è Lex: NaijaLawGPT - Virtual Legal Assistant
Lex is a full-stack, AI-powered legal assistant designed to streamline legal research, document drafting, and analytics for legal professionals practicing Nigerian law. This repository contains the modern, interactive frontend interface and the core n8n workflow that manages the legal AI processing pipeline.
‚ú® Features
Frontend (User Interface)
 * Interactive Design: Built with React and Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first, professional interface featuring an Indigo and Teal color scheme.
 * Command Selector: A dedicated control panel allowing users to specify their intent (Research, Drafting, or Analytics) for better AI context.
 * NDPR Compliance: Explicit Nigerian Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) consent check integrated into the workflow, essential for legal tech in Nigeria.
 * Real-time Feedback: Clear loading spinners, error messages, and formatted output using a custom Markdown renderer.
Backend (AI Workflow)
 * n8n Automation: The entire logic pipeline is managed by a single n8n workflow for modularity and easy auditing.
 * Advanced LLM Integration: Utilizes Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via HTTP Request) as the core legal reasoning engine.
 * Audit Logging: Logs all user commands, timestamps, and consent status for compliance purposes.
 * Mock Legal API Integration: Includes a node structure for integrating with a proprietary legal database (mocked as LawPavilion API) to ground results in Nigerian case law.
 * Contextual Routing: Switches logic paths based on the user's selected command_type (Research, Drafting, Analytics) for optimized responses.
üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The project is architecturally decoupled:
 * Frontend (PWA): A single-file React application (index.html via Babel/CDN) hosted on GitHub Pages. It handles the UI, user input, and API calls.
 * Backend (Workflow): A dedicated n8n instance hosting the workflow. It receives the webhook, performs validation, calls the LLM, integrates data, and formats the final legal output.
üöÄ Setup and Deployment
1. Backend Deployment (n8n Workflow)
The entire backend logic is contained within the lex_n8n_workflow.json file.
 * Host n8n: Set up your own dedicated n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud).
 * Import Workflow: Import the contents of the lex_n8n_workflow.json file into your n8n environment.
 * Configure Webhook: Activate the Webhook node and copy the production URL. This is the WEBHOOK_URL needed for the frontend.
 * Set Credentials: You must configure the following credentials within n8n:
   * Anthropic API Key: For the Claude 3.5 Sonnet LLM.
   * Legal API Key: For the mock LawPavilion data retrieval.
   * (Optional) Slack/SendGrid Credentials: For error notifications.
2. Frontend Deployment (GitHub Pages)
The frontend is deployed entirely via the single, self-contained index.html file.
 * Clone Repository: Clone or download the repository containing index.html.
 * Update Webhook URL: Crucially, update the WEBHOOK_URL constant inside the <script type="text/babel"> tag within index.html to point to the URL copied from your active n8n Webhook node.
 * Push to GitHub: Ensure the modified index.html is in the root directory of your GitHub repository.
 * Enable Pages: Go to Settings > Pages and set the source branch to deploy from the / (root) folder.
üí° Usage
 * Select Task: Choose the command type (Research, Drafting, or Analytics).
 * Enter Command: Input your detailed legal query (e.g., "Draft a Deed of Assignment for land in Abuja referencing the Land Use Act 1978").
 * Grant Consent: Check the NDPR consent box.
 * Run Workflow: Click "Run Lex Workflow" to send the command to the n8n backend for processing.
The result, formatted for readability, will appear below the input form.
